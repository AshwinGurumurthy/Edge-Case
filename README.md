# WARROOM — Multi-Agent Incident Analysis Architecture

> *Break it before your users do.*

A multi-agent orchestration architecture for **chaos-engineering / resilience
analysis**, inspired by [WARROOM](#about-warroom). Given a failure drill
(DB down, latency spike, request flood) plus the live metrics it produced, a
team of specialized AI agents collaborates to answer:

> **What broke, how bad is it, and what should I fix before real users hit this?**

This repository implements the **agent architecture only** — the orchestration
graph, the agents, the model split, and the integration seams (MCP control
plane, repo understanding). The actual failure *injection* (Podman/Toxiproxy)
is represented by a control-plane stub that you can wire to a live MCP server.

## The big idea

One generalist LLM asked *"analyze this outage"* gives a plausible, shallow
answer. This architecture instead runs a **war room of narrow specialists** that
deliberately disagree, then reconciles them:

- a **Reviewer** wing that *critiques* (what's risky / buggy / what-if), and
- a **Context** wing that *gathers facts* (the repo, the live infra via MCP,
  known failure patterns),

which **converge in a Debugger** that produces the technical verdict, looped
under a **Big Boss** that decides whether the answer is good enough to ship or
needs another pass.

The quality comes from **structure** (specialization + adversarial review +
fact-grounding + a refinement loop), not from one big model.

## Agent roster

| Agent | Role | Backend |
|---|---|---|
| **Big Boss** | Incident commander. Turns the raw incident into a focused directive, fans work out, and at the end decides **RESOLVED vs ITERATE**. | Ollama |
| **Reviewer · General** | High-level read: system behavior, blast radius, affected user flows. | Ollama (fast) |
| **Reviewer · Bugs** | Hunts concrete defects: missing timeouts/retries/circuit-breakers, pool exhaustion, unhandled exceptions, cascades. | Ollama (fast) |
| **Reviewer · What-If** | Adversarial stress: what if it lasts longer, compounds, or hits at peak? Second-order effects. | Ollama |
| **Reviewer · Lead** | Merges & ranks the three critiques into one prioritized risk list. | Ollama |
| **Context · Understand Repo** | Reads repo signals (stack, structure, key files) and explains which components are implicated. | Anthropic |
| **Context · MCP** | Talks to the **MCP control plane**: reads the live infra snapshot + available failure levers and interprets what infra is doing *right now*. | Anthropic |
| **Context · Common Issues** | Maps the incident to known failure patterns and typical root causes for the stack. | Anthropic |
| **Context · Lead** | Merges the three into one evidence-first factual brief. | Anthropic |
| **Debugger** | Convergence point. Reconciles critique + facts → **severity, what failed, likely cause, action plan**. | Ollama |

---

## The model split

This is the central architectural decision and lives in **one table**:
[`config/settings.py`](config/settings.py) → `AGENT_MODELS`.

| Wing | Backend | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Reviewer subtree** | **Local Ollama** (`mistral` / `gemma4`) | Critique and opinion work is high-volume and benefits from a *diverse panel* of cheap models rather than one expensive call. Runs offline, costs nothing, keeps code private. |
| **Big Boss & Debugger** | **Local Ollama** (heavier model) | Orchestration + synthesis. Local keeps the control loop free and fast; swap to a cloud model in one line if you want stronger judgment. |
| **Context subtree** | **Anthropic API** | Grounding in real repo structure, live infra telemetry, and known failure patterns needs strong long-context reasoning and instruction-following. This is where cloud quality pays off. |

**Graceful degradation:** if Ollama isn't running or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is
unset, the affected agents return clearly labelled `[STUB::...]` output instead
of crashing — so the *entire graph runs end-to-end* for demos and CI with zero
infra. You can literally `python -m src.main` on a fresh checkout and watch the
whole topology execute.

> The spec calls for `mistral`. The defaults ship as `gemma4:e4b` / `gemma4:e2b`
> (already pulled on this machine). Run `ollama pull mistral` and set
> `OLLAMA_MODEL=mistral` in `.env` to match the spec exactly — no code change.

## How the orchestration loop works

1. **Dispatch** — Big Boss reads the incident and emits a directive, then fans
   out to all six worker agents **in parallel**.
2. **Reviewer wing** — General / Bugs / What-If run concurrently; the Reviewer
   Lead waits for all three and produces a ranked critique.
3. **Context wing** — Understand Repo / MCP / Common Issues run concurrently;
   the Context Lead waits for all three and produces a factual brief.
4. **Debugger** — waits for **both** leads, reconciles disagreement, and emits
   the verdict: severity + what failed + likely cause + action plan.
5. **Loop-back** — control returns to Big Boss, which judges the verdict:
   - **RESOLVED** → writes the final response and the graph ends.
   - **ITERATE** → emits feedback and re-runs the wings, **bounded** by
     `WARROOM_MAX_ITERATIONS` (default 2) so it always terminates.

Parallelism is structural: a node fires only once *all* its inbound edges have
completed in the current super-step. That's why the three reviewers run
together, each lead blocks on its three children, and the Debugger blocks on
both leads.

Every node appends to an **append-only audit trail** (`state.log`) so you can
see exactly what ran in what order — useful for a demo and for debugging.

---

## Why LangGraph

The topology has three properties a linear "chain" can't express well:

1. **Fan-out / fan-in** — Big Boss → 6 parallel workers → 2 aggregators →
   1 debugger. LangGraph models this natively with edges; a node runs when its
   dependencies complete.
2. **A real loop** — Debugger → Big Boss → (maybe) back to the workers.
   LangGraph supports cyclic graphs with a `recursion_limit` backstop; we add
   our own `MAX_ITERATIONS` for semantic bounding.
3. **Shared, reducer-merged state** — concurrent nodes write into one typed
   `WarroomState`; the `log` field uses an `operator.add` reducer so parallel
   appends don't clobber each other.

CrewAI (role/task) or a hand-rolled async orchestrator could work, but LangGraph
gives the cleanest, most inspectable mapping of *exactly this* graph — including
a free Mermaid render of the compiled topology.

## Design choices & trade-offs

- **Specialists over a generalist.** More LLM calls, but each prompt is narrow
  and concrete — which small local models follow far better than a broad ask.
- **Two wings, then converge.** Separating *critique* (Reviewer) from *facts*
  (Context) prevents the model from rationalizing; the Debugger has to
  reconcile them, surfacing gaps.
- **Bounded refinement loop.** The Boss can demand another pass, but
  `MAX_ITERATIONS` guarantees termination and predictable cost.
- **Local-first, cloud-where-it-counts.** Most calls are free/local; only the
  fact-grounding wing spends Anthropic tokens.
- **Stub-by-default integrations.** MCP control plane and repo understanding are
  real seams with working stubs, so the architecture is demoable today and
  productionizable later without restructuring.

## Setup

A virtualenv is recommended (the Context wing needs the `anthropic` SDK).

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
./scripts/setup.ps1
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

**Manual:**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows:  . .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# Unix:     source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env        # then add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

**Local models (Reviewer wing):**
```bash
ollama pull mistral         # then set OLLAMA_MODEL=mistral in .env
# (or keep the gemma4 defaults already configured)
```

---

## Running it

```bash
# bundled sample incident (DB Down drill)
python -m src.main

# your own incident
python -m src.main --incident "Latency spike: +800ms on the DB call path, p95 12s, timeouts cascading."

# from a file, against a specific repo
python -m src.main --incident-file examples/db_down.txt --repo /path/to/your/app

# print the compiled graph topology (Mermaid)
python -m src.main --graph
```

Output is the **technical verdict** (severity, what failed, likely cause, action
plan) + the **Big Boss summary** + a **per-node audit trail**.

> No keys/models configured? It still runs — agents emit labelled `[STUB::...]`
> responses so you can watch the full orchestration flow before wiring backends.

## Extending the system

- **Re-point any agent** to a different model/backend: edit one line in
  `config/settings.py` → `AGENT_MODELS`.
- **Add a new specialist:** add a system prompt in `agents/prompts.py`, a node
  function, register it in `graph.py`, and add it to a subtree's fan-out.
- **Go live on the MCP control plane:** replace the stub bodies in
  `src/mcp/client.py` (`list_tools` / `snapshot`) with real calls to your MCP
  server (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:9100`).
- **Richer repo understanding:** extend `src/tools/repo.py` (read key files,
  parse manifests) — it pre-processes cheaply before the Anthropic agent.

## About WARROOM

This architecture is modeled on **WARROOM**, a chaos-engineering and resilience
testing tool that lets developers simulate real system failures (DB outage,
latency injection, traffic surge), observe the blast radius in real time, and
get a plain-English verdict + action plan — *before* failures reach production.
WARROOM's stack: FastAPI backend, an MCP control plane (Podman + Toxiproxy), and
a Flask + Postgres demo app.

This repo reproduces the **interpretation + action-planning brain** as a
multi-agent system: the part that turns raw failure signals into
*"what broke, how bad, what to fix."*
